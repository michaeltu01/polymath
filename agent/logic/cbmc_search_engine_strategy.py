# Instructs the model to generate the solution constraints.
_CONSTRAINTS_MESSAGE: str = """Now you must generate a validation function which contains constraints that assert that a given solution is correct. Your solver tool will then find a solution which satisfies your constraints and thus solve the puzzle. Please adhere to the following rules:

* Express your constraints in Python, but do not use any loops or comprehensions.
* Do not generate constraints that are already enforced by the data type you selected, e.g. if a data type is marked as `unique` you do not need to generate an explicit constraint for this anymore.
* Be consistent! If a class has an explicit `id` or similar field, always use that field when expressing constraints, not the element's location in a container. You cannot assume that its order in a container matches this field, since that order may be non-deterministic to your solver tool.
* To find elements in a collection with specific characteristics, you can use free variables and assumptions instead. Here are a few examples:

Puzzle condition: "Bob is the person who owns a dog"
Constraint:
```
bob = nondet(solution.people)
assume(bob.name == "Bob")
assert bob.pet == "dog"
```

Puzzle condition: "The coffee drinker is taller than the tea drinker"
Constraint:
```
coffee_drinker = nondet(solution.people)
assume(coffee_drinker.drink == "coffee")
tea_drinker = nondet(solution.people)
assume(tea_drinker.drink == "tea")
assert coffe_drinker.height > tea_drinker.height
```

The validation function signature must look as follows:

```
def validate(solution: Solution) -> None
    # Your constraints belong here...
```

Now generate the conditions necessary to check that a solution to the puzzle is correct! Make sure that you consider every condition stated in the puzzle!"
"""

_DATA_STRUCTURE_MESSAGE: str = """Here is the puzzle:

# Instructs the model to format the solver solution according to the requested format
_FORMAT_MESSAGE: str = """Your logic solver tool produced the following solution:

# Instructs the model on how to generate a solution data structure.
_SYSTEM_PROMPT: str = """You are an expert puzzle solving agent with access to a propositional logic solver tool that has a convenient interface optimised for you. Your boss has given you a logic puzzle that he thinks can be mapped to your logic solver tool. You must solve this puzzle in two steps:

1. Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution
2. Define the logical constraints for a valid puzzle solution


I will walk you through these steps one by one. Do not attempt to solve the puzzle or a following step before I tell you to do so. We will now begin with the first step: Define the data type for a valid puzzle solution.

Your solver tool allows you to specify the output solution type as Python classes, with a few additional features:

* Just like in SQL, each field can be marked as unique, meaning no two instances of the class can have the same value, e.g.: `id: Unique[int]`
* Each field can have a value constraint assigned to it, such that only these values are allowed, e.g.: `id: Domain[int, range(1, 11)]` allows id values between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive), or `name: Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]` allows only the strings \"John\", \"Jane\", or \"Peter\". 
* The `list` type allows for a second type argument specifying the size, e.g.: `list[int, 10]`.

Here is an example that uses these features in combination:
```
class Row:
    id: Unique[Domain[int, range(1, 11)]]
    name: Unique[Domain[str, \"John\", \"Jane\", \"Peter\"]]
    music: Unique[Domain[str, \"Jazz\", \"Rock\", \"Pop\"]]

class Table:
    rows: list[Row, 10]
```

Always constrain data types according to all the information you can identify in the puzzle text. This is critical for solving the puzzle.

In order to automatically validate the puzzle solution, your data structure will eventually need to be converted to JSON in the following format, so keep that in mind when deciding on your data structure:
```
{}
```

Now specify the type of a valid solution using this syntax."""
